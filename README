Automatically creates a habtm relationship with optional relationship-specific fields.

What's so great about this?
  - habtm relationships using :through are a bitch
  - all your relationships use a single table
  - clean models

Do this before anything
  script/generate acts_as_relationable
  rake db:migrate

In the model (user.rb for example)
  acts_as_relationable [ :friends, User ], :ratings   # (there should be a Rating model)
  
  u = User.find(:first)
  self.friends << u
  u.friends # [ self ]
  
Sometimes you have data that is unique to the relationship.
For example, maybe some of your friends are family:
  acts_as_relationable [ :friends, User ], :fields => :is_family, :family_name
  
  self.friends.first.is_family?   # true/false

As you create relationship-specific fields, run this generator:
  script/generate acts_as_relationable is_family:boolean family_name:string
  rake db:migrate
