Automatically creates a habtm relationship with optional relationship-specific fields.

What's so great about this?
  - habtm relationships using :through are a bitch
  - all your relationships use a single table
  - clean models

Do this before anything
  script/generate acts_as_relationable
  rake db:migrate

In the model
  acts_as_relationable :books   # (there should be a Book model)
  
In the controller
  b = Book.find :first
  u = User.find :first
  u.books << b
  u.books # [ b ]
  b.users # [ u ], assuming you put acts_as_relationable(:users) in your Book model
  
Sometimes you have data that is unique to the relationship.
For example, maybe some books are your favorites.

Run the generator first
  script/generate acts_as_relationable favorite:boolean why_favorite:string
  rake db:migrate
  
In the model
  acts_as_relationable :books, :fields => [ :favorite, :why_favorite ]
  
  self.books.first.favorite = true
  self.books.first.why_favorite = 'Because its cool'
  self.books.first.save
